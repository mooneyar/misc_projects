You recently signed an abortion law in Wisconsin that does have an exception for the mother\u2019s life, but you\u2019re on the record as having objected to it. Would you really let a mother die rather than have an abortion, and with 83 percent of the American public in favor of a life exception, are you too out of the mainstream on this issue to win the general election?", " Governor Kasich, You chose to expand Medicaid in your state, unlike several other governors on this stage tonight, and it is already over budget by some estimates costing taxpayers an additional $1.4 billion in just the first 18 months.", "You defended your Medicaid expansion by invoking God, saying to skeptics that when they arrive in heaven, Saint Peter isn\u2019t going to ask them how small they\u2019ve kept government, but what they have done for the poor.", "Why should Republican voters, who generally want to shrink government, believe that you won\u2019t use your Saint Peter rationale to expand every government program?", " Alright, gentlemen, we\u2019re gonna switch topics now and talk a bit about terror and national security.", "Governor Christie.

You favored an assault weapons ban as well. In 2004, you said in most cases you identified as a Democrat. Even in this campaign, your critics say you often sound more like a Democrat than a Republican, calling several of your opponents on the stage things like clowns and puppets.

I spent six years as a child growing not far from where we stand tonight. I use to sit on the porch of our home and listen to my grandfather tell stories as he smoked one of three daily cigars.", "One of the things my grandfather instilled in me, was that I was really blessed because I was a citizen of the greatest country in the history of our mankind. But there have always been people in American politics that wanted America to be more like the rest of the world. And In 2008, one of them was elected president of this country and the result has been a disaster.", "Today you have millions of Americans that feel left out and out of place in their own country, struggling to live paycheck to paycheck, called bigots because they hold on to traditional values.", "And around the world, Americas influence has declined while this president has destroyed our military, our allies no longer trust us, and our adversaries no longer respect us. And that is why this election is so important.", "That is why Im running for president. And thats why Im going to ask you for your vote tonight. If you elect me president, we will have a president that believes America is the greatest country in the world and we will have a president that acts like it.", " Well, I understand why they feel that way, because this president hasnt kept us safe. The problem is we had an attack in San Bernardino. And we were paying attention to the most important issue we have faced in a decade since 9/11, and then all the talk was about this proposal, which isnt going to happen.", "But this is whats important to do is we must deal frontally with this threat of radical Islamists, especially from ISIS. This is the most sophisticated terror group that has ever threatened the world or the United States of America. They are actively recruiting Americans. The attacker in San Bernardino was an American citizen, born and raised in this country. He was a health inspector; had a newborn child and left all that behind to kill 14 people.", "We also understand that this is a group thats growing in its governance of territory. Its not just Iraq and Syria. They are now a predominant group in Libya. They are beginning to pop up in Afghanistan. They are increasingly involved now in attacks in Yemen. They have Jordan in their sights.", "This group needs to be confronted with serious proposals. And this is a very significant threat we face. And the president has left us unsafe. He spoke the other night to the American people to reassure us. I wish he hadnt spoken at all. He made things worse. Because what he basically said was we are going to keep doing what were doing now, and what we are doing now is not working.", " He is and so are those that voted for it. There were some that voted for it because they wanted to keep it alive and they were afraid the whole program would expire.", "Heres the world we live in. This is a radical jihadist group that is increasingly sophisticated in its ability, for example, to radicalize American citizens, in its inability to exploit loopholes in our legal immigration system, in its ability to capture and hold territory in the Middle East, as I outlined earlier, in multiple countries.", "This is not just the most capable, it is the most sophisticated terror threat we have ever faced. We are now at a time when we need more tools, not less tools. And that took we lost, the metadata program, was a valuable tool that we no longer have at our disposal.", " Dana, may I interject here?", " Let me be very careful when answering this, because I dont think national television in front of 15 million people is the place to discuss classified information. So let me just be very clear. There is nothing that we are allowed to do under this bill that we could not do before.", "This bill did, however, take away a valuable tool that allowed the National Security Agency and other law \u2014 and other intelligence agencies to quickly and rapidly access phone records and match them up with other phone records to see who terrorists have been calling. Because I promise you, the next time there is attack on \u2014 an attack on this country, the first thing people are going to want to know is, why didnt we know about it and why didnt we stop it? And the answer better not be because we didnt have access to records or information that would have allowed us to identify these killers before they attacked.", " I want to thank Rand for another 30 seconds, because, number one, what hes pointing to is a bill last week that \u2014 amendment that he voted for that only 10 people voted for. You know why? Because its not focused on terrorists. It would have banned anyone from coming here. Someone from Taiwan would not have been able to come here as a tourist.", "Number two, this program, this metadata program is actually more strict than what a regular law enforcement agency has now. If a regular law enforcement agency wants your phone records, all they have to do is issue a subpoena. But now the intelligence agency is not able to quickly gather records and look at them to see who these terrorists are calling. And the terrorists that attacked us in San Bernardino was an American citizen, born and raised in this country. And I bet you we wish we would have had access to five years of his records so we could see who he was working with", " Do I get another 30 seconds? He mentioned me.", " Well, let me begin by saying that we have to understand who ISIS is. ISIS is a radical Sunni group. They cannot just be defeated through air strikes. Air strikes are a key component of defeating them, but they must be defeated on the ground by a ground force. And that ground force must be primarily made up of Sunni Arabs themselves, Sunni Arabs that reject them ideologically and confront them militarily.", "We will have to embed additional American special operators alongside them to help them with training, to help them conduct special missions, and to help improve the air strikes. The air strikes are important, but we need to have an air force capable of it. And because of the budget cuts we are facing in this country, we are going to be left with the oldest and the smallest Air Force we have ever had. We have to reverse those cuts, in addition to the cuts to our Navy and in addition to the cuts to our Army, as well.", "And beyond that, I would say we must win the information war against ISIS. Every war we have ever been involved in has had a propaganda informational aspect to it. ISIS is winning the propaganda war. They are recruiting people, including Americans, to join them, with the promise that they are joining this great apocalyptic movement that is going to defeat the West. We have to show what life is really like in ISIS territory, and we have to show them why ISIS is not invincible, by going out and conducting these attacks and publicizing them to those who they recruit.", " That is accurate. Three times he voted against the Defense Authorization Act, which is a bill that funds the troops. It also, by the way, funds the Iron Dome and other important programs. And I have to assume that if you vote against it in the Senate, you would also veto it as president.", "He has also supported, by the way, a budget that is called the containment budget. And it is a budget that would radically reduce the amount of money we spend on our military. You cant carpet bomb ISIS if you dont have planes and bombs to attack them with. And if we continue those cuts that were doing now, not to mention additional cuts, we are going to be left with the oldest and the smallest Air Force this country has ever had, and that leaves us less safe.", " Yes, let me \u2014 three points of distinction. The first is, if youre an American citizen and you decide to join up with ISIS, were not going to read you your Miranda rights. Youre going to be treated as an enemy combatant, a member of an army attacking this country.", "Number two, we do need our defense capabilities. It is a fact that the cuts we are facing today and the cuts that Senator Cruz would have supported would leave us with an even smaller Air Force and a smaller Navy than the one we are going to be left with.", "And the final point that I would make is Hillary Clinton and Barack Obamas strategy is to lead from behind. It sounds like what he is outlining is not to lead at all. We cannot continue to outsource foreign policy. We must lead. We are the most powerful nation in the world. We need to begin to act like it, again.", " Well, they most certainly will have to be worked on to provide more than what they are doing now. Theres no doubt about it. And theres one \u2014 one major reason why they have not been willing to be a broader part of the coalition, and that is they have lost complete trust and confidence in this president. This president cut a deal with their moral enemy, the Shia, in Iran. And this is the reason why they no longer trust this president and are willing to work alongside them.", "But they have as much invested in this as we do. In fact, more so, for it is the king of Saudi Arabia they want to behead first. Its the king of Jordan that they want to dethrone. Its the \u2014 they want to go into Egypt the way theyve already gone into Libya.", "And on another point that we need to talk about, Assad is one of the main reasons why ISIS even exists to begin with. Assad is a puppet of Iran. And he has been so brutal toward the Sunni within Syria that he created the space that led to the people of Syria themselves to stand up and try to overthrow him. That led to the chaos which allowed ISIS to come in and take advantage of that situation and grow more powerful.", "And the fact that this president led from behind meant there were no alternative groups on the ground to be empowered, leaving ISIS with the prime operating space they needed to become the force they have now become.", " To begin with, Moammar Gadhafi and the revolt against Gadhafi was not started by the United States. It was started by the Libyan people. And the reason why I argued we needed to get involved is because he was going to go one way or the other. And my argument then was proven true, and that is, the longer that civil war took, the more militias would be formed and the more unstable the country would be after the fact.", "As far as Moammar Gadhafi is concerned, by the way, Moammar Gadhafi is the man that killed those Americans over Lockerbie, Scotland. Moammar Gadhafi is also the man that bombed that cafe in Berlin and killed those Marines. And you want to know why Moammar Gadhafi started cooperating on his nuclear program? Because we got rid of Saddam Hussein. And so he got scared that he would be next, and thats why he started cooperating.", "Look, we will have to work around the world with less than ideal governments. The government in Saudi Arabia is not a democracy, but we will have to work with them. The government in Jordan is not perfect, but we will have to work with them. But anti-American dictators like Assad, who help Hezbollah, who helped get those IEDs into Iraq, if they go, I will not shed a tear.", " Yeah. Immigration is not an issue that I read about in the newspaper or watch a documentary on PBS or CNN. Its an issues Ive lived around my whole life. My family are immigrants. My wifes family are immigrants. All of my neighbors are immigrants.", "I see every aspect of this problem. The good, the bad, and the ugly. And heres what we learned in 2013. The American people dont trust the Federal Government to enforce our immigration laws, and we will not be able to do anything on immigration until we first prove to the American people that illegal immigration is under control. And we can do that. We know what it takes to do that.", "It takes at least 20,000 more additional border agents. It takes completing those 700 miles of fencing. It takes a mandatory e-verify system and a mandatory entry/exit tracking system to prevent overstays. After we have done that, the second thing we have to do is reform and modernize the legal immigration system. And after we have done those two things, I think the American people are gonna be reasonable with what do you do with someone who has been in this country for 10 or 12 years who hasnt otherwise violated our laws \u2014 because if theyre a criminal they cant stay. Theyll have to undergo a background check, pay a fine, start paying taxes. And ultimately, theyll given a work permit and thats all theyre gonna be allowed to have for at least 10 years. But you cant get to that third step until you have done the other two things, and that was the lesson we learned in 2013. There is no trust that the Federal Government will enforce the law. They will not support you until you see it done first.", " But Ive answered that question repeatedly. I am personally open \u2014 after all that has happened and after ten years in that probationary status where all they have is a permit, I personally am open to allowing people to apply for a green card.", "That may not be a majority position in my party, but thats down the road. You cant even begin that process until you prove to people \u2014 not just pass a law that says youre gonna bring illegal immigration under control. Youre gonna have to do it and prove to people that its working.", "And that was the lesson of 2013. And its more true today, than it was then. After a migratory crisis on the border with minors coming over that youre seeing start up again now, after all these executive orders the President has issued. More than ever we need to", "  prove to people that illegal immigration is under control.", " Yeah, a couple points. In 2013 we had never faced a crisis like the Syrian refugee crisis now. Up until that point, a refugee meant someone fleeing oppression, fleeing Communism like it is in my community.", "As far as Teds record, Im always puzzled by his attack on this issue. Ted, you support legalizing people who are in this country illegally. Ted Cruz supported a 500-percent increase in the number of H-1 visas, the guest workers that are allowed into this country, and Ted supports doubling the number of green cards.", "So I think whats important for us to understand and there is a way forward on this issue that we an bring our country together on. And while Im president I will do it. And it will begin by bringing illegal immigration under control and proving to the American people.", " No, no, give him time.", " Ted, do you", " Did Ted Cruz fight to support legalizing people that are in this country illegally?", " Does Ted Cruz rule out ever legalizing people that are in this country now?", " Would you rule it out?", " Well, hes just admitted \u2014 as hes just admitted, the reason why those refugees were allowed in was because they messed up in how they used the actual database. They should have know. They didnt because they didnt run the actual law as it exists now. It didnt work well.", "As far as the refugees are concerned, its not that America doesnt want to accept refugees, Wolf. Its that we may not be able to, because this is an issue we have to be 100 percent right on. If we allow 9,999 Syrian refugees into the United States, and all of them are good people, but we allow one person in whos an ISIS killer \u2014 we just get one person wrong, weve got a serious problem.", "And there is not a single person in the national defense apparatus of this country that can guarantee you are going to be 100 percent right. And thats why as president, Ill take this very seriously.", " I do. First, lets explain to people at home who the triad \u2014 what the triad is. Maybe a lot of people havent heard that terminology before. The triad is our ability of the United States to conduct nuclear attacks using airplanes, using missiles launched from silos or from the ground, and also from our nuclear subs ability to attack. And its important \u2014 all three of them are critical. It gives us the ability at deterrence.", "Now, some have become more critical than others; for example, the submarines. And thats the Ohio Class submarine that needs to be modernized. The air component also needs to be modernized. The B-52, as someone earlier pointed out, is an outdated model that was flown by the grandparents of people that are flying it now. And we need a serious modernization program as well on our silo-launched missiles. All three are critical for the defense of the country.", " Thank you. As we near the end of this year, we enter one of the most important elections in a generation. For whats at stake in this election is not simply what partys going to be in charge. But our very identity as a people and as a nation. For over 200 years this has been a special country. A unique place where anyone from anywhere can achieve anything. But now millions of Americans feel like theyre being left behind. Insecure in their future and unsafe in the face of terrorism. This election is about electing a president that will restore our economic vibrancy so that the American dream can expand to reach more people and change more lives than ever before. And rebuild our Military and our intelligence programs so that we can remain the strongest nation on earth. Tonight I ask you for your vote.", "If you do this, we will rebuild this country, and together we will usher in a new American century \u2014 the greatest era in the history of this great land.", " Well, let me begin by answering both the first question and this one, because theyre related. As Ive said many times before, my parents were never rich people. My father was a bartender. My mother was a maid. They worked for a living. But they were successful people, because, despite the fact that they werent well educated and had those jobs, they made enough money to buy a home in a safe and stable neighborhood, retire with dignity, leave all four of their children better off than themselves.", "What makes America special is that we have millions and millions of people that are not rich, that through hard work and perseverance are able to be successful.", "The problem is that today people are not successful working as hard as ever because the economy is not providing jobs that pay enough. If I thought that raising the minimum wage was the best way to help people increase their pay, I would be all for it, but it isnt. In the 20th century, its a disaster.", "If you raise the minimum wage, youre going to make people more expensive than a machine. And that means all this automation thats replacing jobs and people right now is only going to be accelerated.", "Heres the best way to raise wages. Make America the best place in the world to start a business or expand an existing business, tax reform and regulatory reform, bring our debt under control, fully utilize our energy resources so we can reinvigorate manufacturing, repeal and replace Obamacare, and make higher education faster and easier to access, especially vocational training. For the life of me, I dont know why we have stigmatized vocational education. Welders make more money than philosophers. We need more welders and less philosophers.", "If we do that \u2014 and if we do this \u2014 if we do this, we will be able to increase wages for millions of Americans and we will be able to leave everyone better off without making anyone worse off.", " Well, you know, thats an excellent question, because what we are going through in this country is not simply an economic downturn. We are living through a massive economic transformation. I mean, this economy is nothing like what it was like five years ago, not to mention 15 or 20 years ago.", "And it isnt just a different economy. Its changing faster than ever. You know, it took the telephone 75 years to reach 100 million users. It took Candy Crush one year to reach some 100 million users.", "So the world is changing faster than ever, and it is disruptive. Number one, we are in a global competition now, and several of the candidates have said that. There are now dozens of developed economies on this planet that we have to compete with. And we lose that competition because we have the highest business tax rate in the industrialized world, because we have regulations that continue to grow by the billions every single week, because we have a crazy health care law that discourages companies from hiring people, but because were not fully utilizing our energy resources, that if we did, it would bring back all kinds of growth, especially in manufacturing, and because we have an outdated higher education system.", "Our higher education system is completely outdated. It is too expensive, too hard to access, and it doesnt teach 21st century skills. If we do what needs to be done \u2014 tax reform, regulatory reform, fully utilize our energy resources, repeal and replace Obamacare, and modernize higher education, then we can grasp the potential and the promise of this new economy. And we wont just save the American dream. We will expand it to reach more people and change more lives than ever before. And then truly this new century can be a new American century.", " The most important job Im ever going to have, the most important job anyone in this room will ever have, is the job of being a parent. Not the job of being president, or the job of being a senator, or the job of being a congressman.", "You cant have a strong nation without strong values, and no one is born with strong values. They have to be taught to you in strong families and reinforced in you in strong communities.", "And so when we set out to do tax reform, we endeavor to have a pro-family tax code, and we endeavor to do it because we know how difficult it is for families in the 21st century to afford the cost of living.", "It is expensive to raise children in the 21st century, and families that are raising children are raising the future taxpayers of the United States, and everything costs more. In 35 out of 50 states, child care costs more than college.", "There are millions of people watching this broadcast tonight that understand exactly what Im talking about. They dont know how theyre going to make that payment every month, and if they cant make it, they cant work, because someone needs to watch their kids during the day. They dont know how theyre going to save for their kids future, to go to college.", "And so, yes, I have a child tax credit increase, and Im proud of it. I am proud that I have a pro-family tax code, because the pro- family tax plan I have will strengthen the most important institution in the \u2014 in the country, the family.", " Now I get my 60 seconds to respond. Hes talking about my tax plan.", " So let me begin with this. I actually believe \u2014 first of all, this is their money. They do pay.

This is their money. This is not our money.

You can not be a conservative if youre going to keep promoting new programs that youre not going to pay for.", " You know, if I may respond", " I need to add a couple of points to this. The first is, Ive never met Vladimir Putin, but I know enough about him to know he is a gangster. He is basically an organized crime figure that runs a country, controls a $2 trillion economy. And is using to build up his military in a rapid way despite the fact his economy is a disaster.", "He understands only geopolitical strength.

For goodness sake, there is only one pro-American free enterprise democracy in the Middle East, it is the state of Israel.", "And we have a president that treats the prime minister of Israel with less respect than what he gives the ayatollah in Iran. And so our allies in the region dont trust us.", "Vladimir Putin is exploiting that weakness, for purposes of edging the Americans out as the most important geopolitical power broker in the region. And we do have a vested interest. And heres why.", "Because all those radical terrorist groups that, by the way, are not just in Syria and in Iraq, ISIS is now in Libya. They are a significant presence in Libya, and in Afghanistan, and a growing presence in Pakistan.", "Soon they will be in Turkey. They will try Jordan. They will try Saudi Arabia. They are coming to us. They recruit Americans using social media. And they dont hate us simply because we support Israel. They hate us because of our values.

They hate us because women drive in the United States.", "Either they win or we win, and we had better take this risk seriously, it is not going away on its own.", " Can I just add what \u2014 hes right on point there. Do you know why these banks are so big? The government made them big. The government made them big by adding thousands and thousands of pages of regulations.

The small banks, like Governor Bush was saying, they cant deal with all these regulations. They cant deal with all \u2014 they cannot hire the fanciest law firm in Washington or the best lobbying firm to deal with all these regulations.

I dont recall the Sun \u2014 in fact, the Sun-Sentinel endorsed him. In 2008, Barack Obama missed 60 or 70 percent of his votes, and the same newspaper endorsed him again.

Over the last few weeks, Ive listened to Jeb as he walked around the country and said that youre modeling your campaign after John McCain, that youre going to launch a furious comeback the way he did, by fighting hard in New Hampshire and places like that, carrying your own bag at the airport. You know how many votes John McCain missed when he was carrying out that furious comeback that youre now modeling after?", " No Jeb, I dont remember \u2014 well, let me tell you.

Which is what were gonna get if we elect a big government liberal like Hillary Clinton to the White House.", "Thank you, senator.", " Well, first of all, if a company gets caught doing that, they should never be able to use the program again. If you get caught abusing this program, you should never be able to use it again.", "The second thing I said is we need to add reforms, not just increase the numbers, but add reforms.

No, you did.", " Well, youre talking about \u2014 yeah.", " Yeah, but that \u2014 because the math is, if you \u2014 5 percent of a million is a lot more than 5 percent of a thousand.

Today, we have a legal immigration system for permanent residency that is largely based on whether or not you have a relative living here.

It has to be based on what skills you have, what you can contribute economically, and most important of all, on whether or not youre coming here to become an American, not just live in America, but be an American.", " No. No. What I said was that I think that Dr. Carsons ideas are good ideas. Theyre not my ideas, and I dont necessarily agree with all of them.", "But this is what youre seeing in the Republican debate that you didnt see in that Democrat debate.", "You didnt see it for a minute. You didnt see these kind of ideas being batted around, and being batted around in a way thats civil and smart and thats trying to help to inform the voter out there.", "What you saw was a parade of, Ill give you this for free; Ill give you that for free.", "Let me tell you, everybody, when they say they want to give it to you for free, keep your hands on your wallets because theyre coming to you to pay for it.

The Republican Party is blessed to have 11 good candidates, (inaudible) 10 good candidates. The Democrats cant even come up with one.", "And on this issue of the Medicare in particular, its important because theyre going to demagogue what were saying here tonight. Everyone up here tonight thats talking about reforms, I think and I know for myself I speak to this, were all talking about reforms for future generations. Nothing has to change for current beneficiaries. My mother is on Medicare and Social Security. Im against anything thats bad for my mother.", "So, were talking about \u2014 were talking about reform for people like me and people like Senator Cruz, as he talked about earlier, who are years away from retirement that have a way to plan for these changes, and way thats very reasonable.

You know, the largest retailer in the country and the world today, Amazon, doesnt even own a single store? And these changes have been disruptive. They have changed peoples lives.

The first is, the evidence is now clear that the majority of people coming across the border are not from Mexico. Theyre coming from Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras. Those countries are the source of the people that are now coming in its majority.", "I also believe we need a fence. The problem is if El Chapo builds a tunnel under the fence, we have to be able to deal with that too. And thats why you need an e-verify system and you need an entry-exit tracking system and all sorts of other things to prevent illegal immigration. But I agree with what Governor Kasich just said. People are frustrated. This is the most generous country in the world when it comes to immigration. There are a million people a year who legally immigrate to the United States, and people feel like were being taken advantage of. We feel like despite our generosity, were being taken advantage of.", "And let me tell you who never gets talked about in these debates.

And theyre wondering, maybe they should come illegally.", " Well, first off, I too believe in curriculum reform. It is critically important in the 21st Century. We do need curriculum reform.

The Department of Education, like every federal agency, will never be satisfied. They will not stop with it being a suggestion. They will turn it into a mandate.", "In fact, what they will begin to say to local communities is, you will not get federal money unless do you things the way we want you to do it. And they will use Common Core or any other requirements that exists nationally to force it down the throats of our people in our states.", " Thats a great question.", " Thats a great question.", "First of all, it begins by having leaders that recognize that the economy we live in today is dramatically different from the one we had five years ago. Its an economy that now has placed us in global competition with dozens of other countries around the world.", "Now, the big companies that have connections with Washington, they can affect policies to help them, but the small companies like the one Tania is talking about, theyre the ones that are struggling.", "The first thing we need to do is we need to even out the tax code for small businesses so that we lower their tax rate to 25 percent, just as we need to lower it for all businesses.", "We need to have a regulatory budget in America that limits the amount of regulations on our economy.

I am. And together, if you join me, we will take our country back.", " Well, first of all, I must say as I think about that question, I think about a woman I met the other day. I would guess she was 40 years old. She had several children. And she said to me, you know, Carly, I go to bed every night afraid for my childrens future. And that really struck me. This is America. A mother is going to bed afraid for her childrens future.", "And the reason shes afraid for her childrens future is because weve had problems for a long time. Yes, problems have gotten much worse under Democrats. But the truth is, this government has been growing bigger and bigger, more corrupt, less effective, crushing the engine of economic growth for a very long time. This isnt about just replacing a Democrat with a Republican now. Its about actually challenging the status quo of big government.", "Big government has created a big business called politics. And there are lots of people invested in the status quo of that big business called politics. Specifically, we need actually to do five things to really get this economy going again.

Go to a three-page tax code. Yes, there are plans that would reform our tax code to three pages. In addition to rolling back what President Obama has done, we need to do a top-to-bottom review of every single regulation on the books. That hasnt been done in 50 years. We need to pass the REINS Act so Congress is in charge of regulation, not nameless, faceless bureaucrats accountable to no one. Weve become a nation of rules, not a nation of laws.", "And finally we actually, yes, have to hold government officials accountable for their performance.

As government gets bigger, and bigger \u2014 and it has been for 50 years under republicans and democrats alike \u2014 and business have to bulk up to deal with big government.", "So, we have to repeal it. Its tens of thousands of pages long, no one can possible understand it except the big companies, the lawyers, the accountants, the lobbyists that they hire to protect their interests.

Its my turn.", " I got about four minutes in the last debate. Im going to get my question right now.", " Yes.", " First of all, we could get to 4 percent growth. The new normal of 2 percent puts huge demands on government. The reason why we have structural deficits is that more and more people are relying on government and the growth that we dont have makes \u2014 makes the deficit grow.", "A 4 percent growth strategy starts with tax reform. And the proposal that Ive laid out is the one the Wall Street Journal editorial board has said is the most pro-growth of all the proposals out there. We cut the \u2014 we eliminate a lot of deductions and cut the rates down. A corporate rate of 20 percent, which puts us 5 percent above \u2014 below that of China, and allows us full expensing of investing.

For those that are already in existence, the regulation of the Internet, we have to start over, but we ought to do that.", "The clean power act, we ought to repeal that and \u2014 and start over on that. The waters of the United States act, which is going to be devastating for agriculture and many industries, we should repeal that. We should repeal the rules because the economic costs of this far exceed the social benefit.", "Hillary Clinton has said that Barack Obamas policies get an A. Really? One in 10 people right now arent working or have given up altogether, as you said. Thats not an A. One in seven people are living in poverty. Thats not an A. One in five children are on food stamps. That is not an A. It may be the best that Hillary Clinton can do, but its not the best America can do.", " Thank you, Donald, for allowing me to speak at the debate. Thats really nice of you. Really appreciate that.", "What a generous man you are. Twelve million illegal immigrants, to send them back, 500,000 a month, is just not \u2014 not possible. And its not embracing American values.

Thats the problem with this. We have to win the presidency. And the way you win the presidency is to have practical plans. Lay them out there.

Of course its the highest priority.", "If we dont do that, were stuck with the new normal of 2 percent growth. Hillary Clinton says, basically, we just gotta get used to it.

Thats the lesson of history, and, sadly, this president does not believe in American leadership. He does not believe it, and the net result is that we have a caliphate the size of Indiana that gains energy each and everyday to recruit Americans in our own country, and the threat to the homeland relates to the fact that we have not dealt with this threat of terror in the Middle East.", "We should have a no fly zone in Syria.

My worry is that the real economy has been hurt by the vast overreach of the Obama administration.", "And Hillary Clinton, she wants to double down on that. She wants to create even more so.

She was \u2014 hinted she was for the XL pipeline. Now shes opposed to it. All the things that would create sustained economic growth shes now doubling down against it.", " You could, if you were serious about", " No, I cant say that.

Its going to implode in 2017, just like youre sitting there. It doesnt work. Nothing works in our country. If Im elected president, we will win again. We will win a lot. And were going to have a great, great country, greater than ever before.", "Thank you.", " I cant be Neil. And the and the reason I cant be is that we are a country that is being beaten on every front economically, militarily. There is nothing that we do now to win. We dont win anymore. Our taxes are too high. Ive come up with a tax plan that many, many people like very much. Its going to be a tremendous plan. I think itll make our country and our economy very dynamic.", "But, taxes too high, wages too high, were not going to be able to compete against the world. I hate to say it, but we have to leave it the way it is. People have to go out, they have to work really hard and have to get into that upper stratum. But we can not do this if we are going to compete with the rest of the world. We just cant do it.", " I would not do it.", " I was so happy yesterday when I saw that decision come down. That was an unbelievable decision.", "And we dont have enough of those decisions coming down. He of the executive order, because nobody wants to listen to him, including the Democrats, so he just goes around signing executive orders. That was a great day. And, frankly, we have to stop illegal immigration. Its hurting us economically. Its hurting us from every standpoint. Its causing tremendous difficulty with respect to drugs and what that does to many of our inner cities in particular.", "And it really is \u2014 was such an unbelievable moment because the courts have not been ruling in our favor. And it was a 2-1 decision. And it was a terrific thing that happened.", "And I will tell you, we are a country of laws. We need borders. We will have a wall. The wall will be built.

Believe me.", " You are going to have to bring people \u2014 you are going to have to send people out. Look, were a country", " Maria, were a country of laws.

They moved a 1.5 million out. We have no choice. We have no choice.", " No, its unfair.", " We have millions of people right now on line trying to come into this country.

It is a deal that is going to lead to nothing but trouble. Its a deal that was designed for China to come in, as they always do, through the back door and totally take advantage of everyone. Its 5,600 pages long. So complex that nobodies read it. Its like Obamacare; nobody ever read it. They passed it; nobody read it. And look at mess we have right now. And it will be repealed.", "But this is one of the worst trade deals. And I would, yes, rather not have it. With all of these countries, and all of the bad ones getting advantage and taking advantage of what the good ones would normally get, Id rather make individual deals with individual countries. We will do much better. We lose a fortune on trade. The United States loses with everybody. Were losing now over $500 billion in terms of imbalance with China, $75 billion a year imbalance with Japan. By the way, Mexico, $50 billion a year imbalance.", "So I must say, Gerard, I just think its a terrible deal. I love trade. Im a free trader, 100 percent. But we need smart people making the deals, and we dont have smart people making the deals.", " Yes. Well, the currency manipulation they dont discuss in the agreement, which is a disaster. If you look at the way China and India and almost everybody takes advantage of the United States \u2014 China in particular, because theyre so good. Its the number-one abuser of this country. And if you look at the way they take advantage, its through currency manipulation. Its not even discussed in the almost 6,000-page agreement. Its not even discussed.", " And as you understand, I mean, you understand very well from the Wall Street Journal, currency manipulation is the single great weapon people have. They dont even discuss it in this agreement.", "So I say, its a very bad deal, should not be approved. If it is approved, it will just be more bad trade deals, more loss of jobs for our country. We are losing jobs like nobodys ever lost jobs before. I want to bring jobs back into this country.", " Well, first of all, its not only Russia. We have problems with North Korea where they actually have nuclear weapons. You know, nobody talks about it, we talk about Iran, and thats one of the worst deals ever made.

Thats a problem.", "China is a problem, both economically in what theyre doing in the South China Sea, I mean, they are becoming a very, very major force. So, we have more than just Russia.

But, we have no idea who these people, and what theyre going to be, and what theyre going to represent. They may be far worse than Assad. Look at Libya. Look at Iraq.

You make $10 billion, you pay a billion. You make $10, you pay one. You get same rights and privileges.", "I dont see how anything gets a whole lot fairer than that. But you also have to get rid of all the deductions and all the loopholes because that is the thing that tilts it in one direction or another. And you have to set the rate at an appropriate level.", "Now I will say that, there are a lot of people who say, if you get rid of the deductions, you ruin the American dream because, you know, home mortgage deduction. But the fact of the matter is, people had homes before 1913 when we introduced the federal income tax, and later after that started deductions.", "And they say there will be no more charitable giving. We had churches before that and charitable organizations before that. The fact of the matter is, I believe if you put more money in peoples pockets that they will actually be more generous rather than less generous. And its", " the money that they earned.", "And, the other thing is, I do care about the poor people. And in the system that were putting together, there will be a rebate for people at the poverty level. But I also want to emphasize the fact that as we get the economy moving, and I hope I get a question about how do we get the economy moving, there will be a lot more opportunities for poor people not to be poor people because this is America.", "This is the land of dreams. And our policies should be aimed at allowing people to realize that dream.", " Well, putting the special ops people in there is better than not having them there, because they \u2014 thats why theyre called special ops, theyre actually able to guide some of the other things that were doing there.", "And what we have to recognize is that Putin is trying to really spread his influence throughout the Middle East. This is going to be his base. And we have to oppose him there in an effective way.", "We also must recognize that its a very complex place. You know, the Chinese are there, as well as the Russians, and you have all kinds of factions there.", "What weve been doing so far is very ineffective, but we cant give up ground right there. But we have to look at this on a much more global scale. Were talking about global jihadists. And their desire is to destroy us and to destroy our way of life. So we have to be saying, how do we make them look like losers? Because thats the way that theyre able to gather a lot of influence.", "And I think in order to make them look like losers, we have to destroy their caliphate. And you look for the easiest place to do that? It would be in Iraq. And if \u2014 outside of Anbar in Iraq, theres a big energy field. Take that from them. Take all of that land from them. We could do that, I believe, fairly easily, Ive learned from talking to several generals, and then you move on from there.", "But you have to continue to face them, because our goal is not to contain them, but to destroy them before they destroy us.", " Well, I think we should have policies that dont allow them to just enlarge themselves at the expense of smaller entities. And certainly some of the policies, some of the monetary and Fed policies that were using makes it very easy for them, makes it very easy for the big corporations, quite frankly, at these very low interest rates to buy back their stock and to drive the price of that up artificially. Those are the kinds of things that led to the problem in the first place.", "And I think this all really gets back to this whole regulation issue which is creating a very abnormal situation. This country was \u2014 declared its independence in 1776. In less than 100 years, it was the number-one economic power in the world. And the reason was because we had an atmosphere that encouraged entrepreneurial risk- taking and capital investment. Those are the fuels that drive it.", "And what weve done now is let the creep of regulation turn into a stampede of regulations, which is involved in every aspect of our lives. If we can get that out, it makes a big difference. And even for the average person, every single regulation costs money. And its shifted to the individual.", "So \u2014 and it hurts the poor and the middle class much more than it does the rich. They go into the store and they buy a bar of soap, it costs 10 cents more, they notice it. And the middle class, when they come to the cash register, have a whole cart full of things that cost 5, 10 or 15 cents more, they notice it. It is hurting the poor.", "Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton wont tell you that thats the thing thats really hurting middle class in the core. Theyll say its the rich, take their money, but that wont help. You can take all of the richs money and it wont make a dent in the problem that were having. We have to come back to the fundamental principles that made America great.", " I would have policies that wouldnt allow that to occur. I dont want to go in and tear anybody down. I mean, that doesnt help us. But what does help us is stop tinkering around the edges and fix the actual problems that exist that are creating the problem in the first place.", " In the two hours of this \u2014 of this debate, five people have died from drug-related deaths, $100 million has been added to our national debt, 200 babies have been killed by abortionists, and two veterans have taken their lives out of despair. This is a narrative that we can change, not we the Democrats, not we the Republicans, but we the people of America, because there is something special about this nation, and we must embrace it and be proud of it and never give it away for the sake of political correctness.", " Probably in terms of the applying for the job of president, a weakness would be not really seeing myself in that position until hundreds of thousands of people began to tell me that I needed to do it. I do, however, believe in Reagans 11th commandment, and will not be engaging in awful things about my compatriots here.", "And recognizing that its so important, this election, because were talking about America for the people versus America for the government.", " Well, first of all, I didnt say that the rate would be 10 percent. I used the tithing analogy.", " The rate \u2014 the rate \u2014 the rate is gonna be much closer to 15 percent.", " You also have to get rid of all the deductions and all the loopholes. You also have to some strategically cutting in several places.", "Remember, we have 645 federal agencies and sub-agencies. Anybody who tells me that we need every penny and every one of those is in a fantasy world.", "So, also, we can stimulate the economy. Thats gonna be the real growth engine. Stimulating the economy \u2014 because its tethered down right now with so many regulations", " Thats not true.", " When \u2014 when we put all the facts down, youll be able to see that its not true, it works out very well.", " Since I was attacked too.", " Let me just say, if youre talking about an $18 trillion economy, youre talking about a 15 percent tax on your gross domestic product. Youre talking about $2.7 trillion. We have a budget closer to $3.5 trillion.", "But if you also apply that same 15 percent to several other things, including corporate taxes, and including the capital gains taxes, you make that amount up pretty quickly. So that is not by any stretch a pie in the sky.", " Well, there is no question that some people go overboard when it comes to trying to make profits, and they dont take into consideration the American people. What we have to start thinking about, as leaders, particularly in government, is what can we do for the average American? And you think about the reasons that were having such difficulty right now with our job market.", "Well, the average small manufacturer, whatever theyre manufacturing, drugs or anything, if they have less than 50 employees, the average cost in terms of regulations is $34,000 per employee. Makes it a whole lot easier for them to want to go somewhere else.", "So what were going to have to start doing instead of, you know, picking on this group or this group, is were going to have to have a major reduction in the regulatory influence that is going on.", "The government is not supposed to be in every part of our lives, and that is what is causing the problem.", " Well, obviously, you dont understand my views on homosexuality. I believe that our Constitution protects everybody, regardless of their sexual orientation or any other aspect. I also believe that marriage is between one man and one woman. And there is no reason that you cant be perfectly fair to the gay community.", "They shouldnt automatically assume that because you believe that marriage is between one man and one woman that you are a homophobe. And this is one of the myths that the left perpetrates on our society, and this is how they frighten people and get people to shut up. You know, thats what the PC culture is all about, and its destroying this nation.", "The fact of the matter is we the American people are not each others enemies, its those people who are trying to divide us who are the enemies. And we need to make that very clear to everybody.", "I did a couple of speeches for them, I do speeches for other people. They were paid speeches. It is absolutely absurd to say that I had any kind of a relationship with them.", "Do I take the product? Yes. I think its a good product.", " If somebody put me on their homepage, they did it without my permission.", " No, it speaks to the fact that I dont know those \u2014", "See? They know.", " Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy. I have", " the best results, wouldnt that be nice if the country could do that?", "But I will be putting \u2014 I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money. Super PACs are a disaster. Theyre a scam. They cause dishonesty. And you had better get rid of them, because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.", "And Im not blaming these folks \u2014 but I guess I could.", "Very good people are making very bad decisions right now. And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you had better get rid of the super PACs, because theyre causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and whats going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that are being made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.", " Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy. I have studied that issue in great detail. And what I have concluded is that the best policy is to get rid of all government subsidies, and get the government out of our lives, and let people rise and fall based on how good they are.", "And \u2014 you know, all of this too big to fail stuff and picking and choosing winners and losers \u2014 this is a bunch of crap, and it is really causing a great deal of \u2014 great deal of problems for our society right now.", "And \u2014 and \u2014 you know, it goes back to the whole concept of regulations, which are in everything. The reason that I \u2014 I hate them so much is because every single regulation costs in terms of goods and services.", "That cost gets passed on to the people. Now, who are the people who are hurt by that? Its poor people and middle class. Doesnt hurt rich people if their bar of soap goes up ten cents, but it hurts the poor and the middle class.", "And Bernie Sanders will tell them that its because of the rich. Well, Ill tell you something", " About Medicare?", " Well, first of all the \u2014 the plan gives people the option of \u2014 of opting out. But I think they will see a very good option here. You know, the annual Medicare budget is over $600 billion. And there are 48 million people involved \u2014 40 million, 65 and over, and 8 million other.", "Divide that out. That comes out to $12,500 for each one. Now, I can tell you there are a lot of private-sector things that you could do with $12,500, which will get you a lot more than you get from this government program.", "And thats really a theme of a lot of the things that Im talking about. How do we utilize our intellect rather than allowing the government to use its, quote, intellect, in order to help us to be able to live healthier and better lives?", "It was never intended that the government should be in every aspect of our lives. This is a country that is of, for and by the people.", " I just want to thank all my colleagues here for being civil, and not falling for the traps. And, I also just want to thank the audience for being attentive, and noticing the questions, and the noticing the answers. And, this is what I am finding throughout America.", "People are waking up because it is going to be us who will determine the direction of our country. And, it was made for we the people, we are the ones who decide who we are, and we should never give away the values and principles that made America into a great nation for the sake of political correctness.", " Well, I could take issue with \u2014 with all of those things, but we dont have time.", "But I will say, we have a debate here tonight, and we will have an opportunity to explore those areas, and Im looking very much forward to demonstrating that, in fact, the thing that is probably most important is having a brain, and to be able to figure things out and learn things very rapidly.", "So, you know, experience comes from a large number of different arenas, and America became a great nation early on not because it was flooded with politicians, but because it was flooded with people who understood the value of personal responsibility, hard work, creativity, innovation, and thats what will get us on the right track now, as well.", " Well, thank you, Megyn, I wasnt sure I was going to get to talk again.", " Alright. You know, what we do in order to get the information that we need is our business, and I wouldnt necessarily be broadcasting what were going to do.", "And Ive talked to a lot of the generals, a lot of our advanced people. And believe me, if we gave them the mission, which is what the commander-in-chief does, they would be able to carry it out.", "And if we dont tie their hands behind their back, they will do it\u2026", " What I agree with is that we need a significantly changed taxation system. And the one that Ive advocated is based on tithing, because I think God is a pretty fair guy.", "And he said, you know, if you give me a tithe, it doesnt matter how much you make. If youve had a bumper crop, you dont owe me triple tithes. And if youve had no crops at all, you dont owe me no tithes. So there must be something inherently fair about that.", "And thats why Ive advocated a proportional tax system. You make $10 billion, you pay a billion. You make $10, you pay one. And everybody gets treated the same way. And you get rid of the deductions, you get rid of all the loopholes, and\u2026", " And I have a lot more to say about it.", " If Hillary is the candidate, which I doubt, that would be a dream come true.", "But you know, the fact of the matter is, she is the epitome of the progressive \u2014 the secular progressive movement. And she counts on the fact that people are uninformed, the Alinsky Model, taking advantage of useful idiots.", "Well, I just happen to believe that people are not stupid.", "You know, you look at the \u2014 the national debt and how its being driven up. If I was trying to destroy this country, what I would do is find a way to drive wedges between all the people, drive the debt to an unsustainable level, and then step off the stage as a world leader and let our enemies increase while we decreased our capacity as a military person. And thats what shes doing.", " Well, what we have to stop and think about is that we have weakened ourselves militarily to such an extent that if affects all of our military policies. Our Navy is at its smallest size since 1917; our Air Force, since 1940. In recent testimony, the commandant of the Marine Corps said half of the non-deployed units were not ready and you know, the sequester is cutting the heart out of our personnel. Our generals are retiring because they dont want to be part of this, and at the same time, our enemies are increasing.", "Our \u2014 our friends cant trust us anymore. You know, Ukraine was a nuclear-armed state. They gave away their nuclear arms with the understanding that we would protect them. We wont even give them offensive weapons.", "You know, we turned our back on Israel, our ally. You know, and a situation like that, of course Obamas not going to be able to do anything. I would shore up our military first, because if you dont get the military right, nothing else is going to work.", " Well, I think the bully pulpit is a wonderful place to start healing that divide. You know, we have the purveyors of hatred who take every single incident between people of two races and try to make a race war out of it, and drive wedges into people. And this does not need to be done.", "What we need to think about instead \u2014 you know, I was asked by an NPR reporter once, why dont I talk about race that often. I said its because Im a neurosurgeon. And she thought that was a strange response. And you say \u2014 I said, you see, when I take someone to the operating room, Im actually operating on the thing that makes them who they are. The skin doesnt make them who they are. The hair doesnt make them who they are. And its time for us to move beyond that.", " Well, I havent said anything about me being the only one to do anything, so let me try that.", "Im the only one to separate siamese twins\u2026", "The \u2014 the only one to operate on babies while they were still in mothers womb, the only one to take out half of a brain, although you would think, if you go to Washington, that someone had beat me to it.", "But I \u2014 but Im very hopeful that Im not the only onel whos willing to pick up the baton of freedom, because freedom is not free, and we must fight for it every day.

And theres no way that you can raise what you need in order to compete successfully.", "I in no way am willing to get in the bed with special interest group or lick the boots of billionaires. I have said to the people if they want me to do this, please get involved. And we now have over 500,000 donations, and the money is coming in.", "But the pundits forgot about one thing, and that is the people. And they are really in charge.", " Well, first of all, I recognize that we have an incredible illegal immigration problem. I was down in Arizona a few weeks ago at the border. I mean, the fences that were there were not manned, and those are the kind of fences when I was a kid that would barely slow us down. So, I dont see any purpose in having that.", "Now, what we need to do is look at something that actually works. Yuma County, Arizona. They stop 97 percent of the illegal immigrants through there. They put in a double fence with a road so that there was quick access by the enforcement people.", "If we dont seal the border, the rest of this stuff clearly doesnt matter. Its kind of ridiculous all the other things we talk about. We have the ability to do it, we dont have the will to do it.", "There was one area where they had cut a hole in the fence, and to repair it, they put a few strands of barb wire across. Well, the photographers who were there with us, they wanted to photograph us from the side of the Mexicans, and they went through there, and they were not physically fit people, and they took their cameras and things with them, and shot us from the other side.", "Thats how easy it is to get across. And, the drugs, I mean, it goes on, and on, and on. ICE tells them to release these people, 67,000 criminals released\u2026", " \u2026on to our property, its ridiculous.", " Well, I have also said, if anybody knows how to do that, that I would be willing to listen. And, if they can, you know, specify exactly how thats going to be done, and what the cost, and it sounds reasonable, then I think its worth discussing\u2026", " Not exactly what I said.", " Well, what I said, after we seal the borders, after we turn off the spigot that dispenses all the goodies so we dont have people coming in here, including employment, that people who had a pristine record, we should consider allowing them to become guest workers, primarily in the agricultural sphere, because thats the place where Americans dont seem to want to work.", "Thats what I said. And they have a six-month period to do that. If they dont do it within that time period, then they become illegal, and as illegals, they will be treated as such.", " Can I \u2014 can I \u2014 can I just\u2026", " Can I correct\u2026", " OK.", " My plan is not amnesty for a number of reasons.", "Number one, you know, Ive talked to farmers, and they said they cannot hire Americans to do the kind of job that Im talking about.", "And the second reason is because the individuals who register as guest workers, they dont get to vote, they are not American citizens, and they dont get the rights and privileges of American citizens. So thats key.", "But the other thing that I want to bring up is, I mentioned something earlier. I think it was just sort of glossed over.", "I talked about the success in Yuma County, I mean, incredible success, and the Department of Justice said, No, we dont want to do that. Thats too successful.", "We dont have to keep reinventing the wheel. All we have to do is look at things that work. All we have to do is use a little common sense.", " Its all about America. You know, the people who say the guy who paid a billion dollars because he had 10, he has still got $9 billion left, thats not fair, we need to take more of his money. Thats called socialism. That doesnt work so well.", "What made America into a great nation was the fact that we said, that guy just put in $1 billion, lets create an environment thats even more conducive to his success so that next year he can put in $2 billion.", "And thats the kind of thing that helps us to grow. We cant grow by continuing to take a piece of pie, and dividing it, and redistributing it.", "But, Im also looking at what doctor \u2014 at what Governor Huckabee talked about\u2026", " The Fair Tax. Looking at both of them, and evaluating them both, and Im talking to the American people because one of the things we must recognize is that this country is of, for, and by the people. And, its really time that the government get out of the way, and let the people be the ones who decide how they want to run their country.", " Well, first of all, let me say what I actually said about raising the minimum wage. I was asked should it be raised, I said, probably, or possibly. But, what I added, which I think is the most important thing, so, I said we need to get both sides of this issue to sit down, and talk about it. Negotiate a reasonable minimum wage, and index that so that we never have to have this conversation again in the history of America.", "I think we also have to have two minimum wages, a starter, and a sustaining because how are young people ever going to get a job if you have such a high minimum wage that it makes it impractical to hire them\u2026", " Jake, Jake\u2026", " I havent had an opportunity to weigh in on foreign policy, and I just want to mention that when the war, when the issue occurred in 2003, I suggested to President Bush that he not go to war? OK. So I just want that on the record.", "And, you know, a lot of people are very much against us getting involved right now with global jihadism. And they refer back to our invasion of Iraq. And they seem to think that that was what caused it.", "What caused it was withdrawing from there and creating a vacuum which allowed this terrible situation to occur. But it is very different from what is going on today. Were talking about global jihadists who actually want to destroy us.", "They are an existential threat to our nation. And we have to be mature enough to recognize that our children will have no future if we put our heads in the sand.

Bush is a great friend of ours, and we spent many wonderful days at the White House. I havent been there in the last seven years. I probably have to have a food-tester.", "But at any rate, I didnt suggest that nothing be done. What I suggested to President Bush is to be Kennedy-esque, in the sense that when the Russians got ahead of us in the space race, what we did is use the bully pulpit to galvanize everybody, business, industry, academia behind a national goal to put a man on the moon and bring him back safely.", "I said, you can do the same kind of thing.

Now that the Internet shopping playing field has matured, what would be a fair plan to even that playing field?", " Mrs. Fiorina.", " OK.", " Thank you very much.", "In terms of all of that, it raises the question whether you have the maturity and wisdom to lead this $17 trillion economy. What do you say?", " Dr. Carson, we know you as a physician, but we wanted to ask you about your involvement on some corporate boards, including Costco\u2019s. Last year, a marketing study called the warehouse retailer the number one gay-friendly brand in America, partly because of its domestic partner benefits.", "Why would you serve on a company whose policies seem to run counter to your views on homosexuality?", " To be fair, you were on the homepage of their website with the logo over your shoulder \u2014", " Does that not speak to your vetting process or judgment in any way.", " Apparently. We will take a break. We\u2019ll be back in Boulder in just a minute.", " ...We\u2019ll come back around. I want to get to governor Kasich.", " Governor Kasich, let\u2019s talk ...", " Alright, but 30 seconds, you made a case. Sure, 30 seconds.", " Senator, thank you.", " Oh, no, no, no...", " ...Ok...", " ...We\u2019re going to go to...", " OK. Thank you, Senator. Governor Kasich, let\u2019s talk about marijuana. We\u2019re broadcasting from Colorado which has seen $150 million in new revenue for the state since legalizing last year. Governor Hickenlooper is not a big fan of legalization, but he\u2019s said the people who used to be smoking it are still smoking it, they\u2019re just now paying taxes.", "Given the budget pressures in Ohio, and other states, is this a revenue stream you\u2019d like to have?", " Thank you, Governor.", " Thank you. We\u2019ll be back from Boulder, Colorado in just a moment.", " Mr. Trump, you\u2019ve said you have a special permit to carry a gun in New York.", " After the Oregon mass shooting on October 1st, you said, \u201cBy the way, it was a gun-free zone. If you had a couple of teachers with guns, you would have been a hell of a lot better off.\u201d", " Would you feel more comfortable if your employees brought guns to work?", " Are you carrying one now?", " We called a few Trump resorts, a few Trump properties that \u2014 that do not allow guns with or without a permit. Would you change those policies?", " OK. All right. Thank you.", "John?", " Governor Bush, daily fantasy sports has become a phenomenon in this country, will award billions of dollars in prize money this year. But to play you have to assess your odds, put money at risk, wait for an outcome that\u2019s out of your control. Isn\u2019t that the definition of gambling, and should the Federal Government treat it as such?", " I had a feeling you were going to brag about that.", " This is the\u2014 well, we\u2019re going to take a break. We want to save time for closing statements after the break.", "So this is the Republican presidential debate in Boulder, and we\u2019ll be right back.", " Senator Rubio...", " ...yeah, I just wanted (inaudible).", " I want to give you 30 seconds here.", " That concludes tonight\u2019s debate.

We\u2019re sitting up here talking about all these other things; 71 percent of federal spending today is on entitlements, and debt service. And, that\u2019s with zero percent interest rates.", "Now, I\u2019m the only person that\u2019s put out a detailed plan on how to deal with entitlements.

What Hillary Clinton\u2019s going to say, and has said before is, she wants to raise Social Security taxes.", "Now, let me ask you a question everybody, and, this is for the guy, you know, who owns a landscaping business out there.
